To use the plot functions: 

- Download all of the functions and scripts contained in this folder 
- Import the 2017 race data (in struct format) that you wish to use into Matlab
- Run the 'plotter.m' script to use all of the plot functions, use the individual functions in your own scripts, or run the plot functions directly from the command prompt 

Individual function documentation can be found in the comments of each function. 

Note that proper formatting of plots for these particular scripts requires MATLAB 2014b or newer.
